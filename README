capabilities to make sure that efficiency in
collaboration is achieved.

If you are reading this document, you may be using
the first prototype of Nimbus. You may find this
build a bit unstable as it may contain experimental
implementations of unfinished systems. this software
is labeled as "ALPHA" as it is only available to a
select few and to those belonging to the test group
and the defense panel. The test group and the
defense panel is in no way affiliated with Nimbus.
